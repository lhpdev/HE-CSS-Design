# HE-CSS-Design

This project is being developed for studies porpuse of CSS styling.

It is the sketch of the game design development of Hacker Experience 2 Game.

Everything is being done from the very bottom and the main idea is figuring out more efficient and 
less payingful css ways to build up the game interface.

It also has some JavaScript functions to handle mouse events on it. Nothing really fancy.

By the end hopefully it is gonna reach a very organized and responsive design.
